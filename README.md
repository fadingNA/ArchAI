### 🏗️ SaaS Idea: “ArchiMind” – AI Architecture Assistant for Foundational Planning

🎯 Mission:

Help architects, developers, and even clients focus on core architectural principles and constraints before jumping into development. Catch oversights early, plan smarter, and design with clarity.

⸻

🧠 What It Does:

ArchiMind is an AI-powered assistant that helps:
	•	Validate architectural foundations (e.g., site constraints, load-bearing elements, zoning codes)
	•	Generate schematic suggestions based on user goals
	•	Analyze plans for missing structural logic (e.g., no foundation under load-bearing wall)
	•	Recommend foundational best practices based on building type (residential, commercial, etc.)
